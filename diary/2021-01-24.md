really interesting article on how to ship ES2015+ code to browser: [read here](https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/)
takeaways:

- don't transpile code to ES5 when not needed
- transpiling everything creates bloat, resulting in slow parsing and
  downloading
- generate separate bundles for ES5 and ES2015+ using webpack
- trick to ship ES6 bundles conditionally:
  - use `<script type="module" src="script.mjs"></script>` for ES6+ bundle
  - use `<script nomodule src="script.es5.js"></script>` for ES5 bundle

browser with exec ES5 version if there's no `module` support available. note
that having availablity of `module` means browser have support for
`async/await`, `promise` and bunch of other ES2015+ goodies
