**NOTES ON SYSTEM AVAILABLITY** - [Backend Engineering Concept](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeDFPvjs51fMBgyyFYdjPsiMcxoQp-aEm)

> availablity of a system = uptime / total time

**redundency:** having multiple _identical_ replica of a system up and running
to make the said system highly available

**total downtime** of the system can be calculated by **multiplying the probability
of downtime of all identical replica**. example:

_sys1_'s downtime probability is 0.2, _sys2_'s downtime probability is 0.15 and
_sys3_'s downtime probability is 1.0. so the combained downtime probability
would be `0.2 x 0.15 x 1.0`, which is `0.03`(i.e. 3%).

**load balancing** is the technique to reduce downtime of a system. a
load-balancer is simply a reverse proxy server which sits in-front of a group
of servers and distributes incoming request to servers which are up and running.

**Importance of a Proxy Server**

- protects client IP address by hiding it
- acts as a first-level firewall
- protects client from visiting malicious sites
- caching
- encrypt client's data and decrypt them on demand
