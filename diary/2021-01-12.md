- worked on an [open-source project](https://github.com/Girl-Code-It/Girl-Code-It-Website-Frontend/pull/91)
- rejected from a job `FrontEnd Developer(React) - Wharf Street Strategies`.
  Reason is probably becuase I didn't put much effort on the assignment they
  asked me to do (could be anything ... really. IDK)
- Initial Screening Test for BackEnd Developer - Hackerrank. Solved one
  problem(string compression). could not solve the other one(prison break)
