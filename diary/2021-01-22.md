- **tail call optimization:** an optimization technique in which a recursive
  [function](function) is converted into iterative function.
  why this optimization is useful? it's possible that a recursive function would
  fill-up all available spaces in stack. to prevent that, a recursive function can
  be converted into iterative codeblock, which would take constant stack space.

  a tail call optimization can be done only when the function returns itself...and
  nothing else. for example:

  ```js
  function factorial(num, a = 1) {
    if (num === 1) return a;
    return factorial(num - 1, num * a);
  }

  factorial(10);
  ```
