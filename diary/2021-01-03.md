**How to Communicate Better** - [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofk6vLZ3hPw&feature=youtu.be)

- **Understand your Audience**. Example:
    - it's pointless to use programming acronyms while communicating with a person
      who does not have a programming background.
    - Similarly, when the other person is holding the same(or more) experience as
      you in Programming, it's better to use acronyms than to elaborate
      everything. chances are they would get bored.
- When you have a huge audience to address, **OverCommunicate**.
  OverCommunicating essentially means that Explain everything as clear as
  possible for more than once, twice or as many times required, so that
  everybody is on the same page by the end of the session.
- Follow a **Structure** while communicating, much like an Essay.
- Using **Intonation** in non-verbal communication. Maybe use Emojis,
  Punctuation marks etc to express yourself better. just use whatever works
  better, you know.
