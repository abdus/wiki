learnt about `readline.emitKeypressEvents`. this listens for `keypress` on
terminal. it also accepts an `interface` which can be used to terminate an event
listener.

```javascript
const iface = readline.createInterface({ input: process.stdin });

readline.emitKeypressEvents(process.stdin, iface);
process.stdin.setRawMode(true);

process.stdin.on("keypress", (key, e) => {
  if (e.ctrl && e.name === "c") {
    process.exit(0);
  }

  if (key && !e.ctrl) {
    resolve(key.toLowerCase());
    process.stdin.setRawMode(false);
    iface.close();
  }
});
```

Something awesome happened. I revived my throw-away and (kind-of) incative
twitter account, all thanks to [Tanay Pratap](https://tanaypratap.com/) and his
discord server. (quite sure he hated me for not reading the channel chat
history before posting)
