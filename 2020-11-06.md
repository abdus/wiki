Changed this LogBook workflow a bit. Now, the dairy content is managed by
VimWiki. And pushed regularly using a Cronjob.

I am planning to publish my vimwiki as a live site. I can still do it
out-of-the-box, but I don't want to bother with VimWiki templates. Guess I will
write a small script for converting markdown to HTML.

Some useful VimWiki shortcuts:

- `<Leader>wi` - Go to Diary Index
- `<Leader>w<Leader>i` - Generate a new Diary Entry(must be in Diary Index)
